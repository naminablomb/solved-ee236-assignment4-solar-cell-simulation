<strong>Simulation Exercise: Effect of series and shunt resistance</strong>

Download the model file for solar cell from downloads Write ngSPICE netlist to plot I/V characteristics for the same for following conditions with the input voltage varied from -2V to 2V:

<ol>

 <li>Dark</li>

 <li>Lighted characteristics for the intensities corresponding to light generated current I L = 8 mA and10 mA.</li>

 <li>Obtain the values of ideality factor , <em>V<sub>oc </sub></em>, <em>I<sub>sc </sub></em>, and fill factor in each case.</li>

</ol>

For <em>I<sub>L</sub></em>=10 mA,

<ol>

 <li>Plot I/V characteristics for series resistance <em>R<sub>S </sub></em>= 0, 10, and 30 Ω. You may plot the part of characteristic in fourth quadrant in the first quadrant for convenience.</li>

 <li>What do you observe?</li>

 <li>Plot I/V characteristics for shunt resistance <em>R<sub>sh </sub></em>= 100Ω, 500Ω, and 5KΩ.</li>

 <li>What do you observe?</li>

 <li>Explain your observations in both the cases.</li>

</ol>
